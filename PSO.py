Particle Swarm Optimisation

It is different from other optimization algorithms
in such a way that only the objective function is needed and
it is not dependent on the gradient or any differential form of the objective.

This is a heuristic solution because we can never prove the real global
optimal solution can be found and it is usually not.
However, we often find that the solution found by PSO is quite close to the global optimal.
